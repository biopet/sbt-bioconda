extra:
  notes: 'testtool is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    By default ''no default java option'' is set in the wrapper. The command that
    runs the program is ''testtool''. If you want to overwrite it you can specify
    memory options directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS set globally
    this will take precedence. For example run it with ''testtool -Xms512m -Xmx1g''. '
